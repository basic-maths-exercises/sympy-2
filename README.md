# Simplifying expressions

In my opinion, the fact that you can write a computer program to work out the derivatives of a function for you is very cool.  I wish I had known about the existence of such things when I had done my degree!  When I do research work and prepare exams, I constantly use programs like the one you have just written to evaluate derivatives.  To be clear, I still do the calculations by hand as well.  I find using both methods extremely useful, however, as I find that I will usually make a sign error in one of the two (distinct) methods that I use to find the derivative.  If the two answers that I obtain are not the same I then know that I have made a mistake somewhere.

Another area where sympy is useful is the simplification of complicated-looking expressions.  Look at the code on the right and then run it.  As you can see we can use the `sy.simplify` function in python to simplify complicated mathematical expressions to simpler forms.

To show that you understand how to use `sy.simplify` modify the code on the left so that it sets the following variables to simplified versions of the following expressions. 

1. `s1` should be a simplified form of ![](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=t^6t^4)
2. `s2` should be a simplified form of ![](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{t^6}{t^4})
3. `s3` should be a simplified form of ![](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{2}{x-2}%2B\frac{3}{x%2B1})
4. `s4` should be a simplified form of ![](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{\sin^4(x)-\cos^4(x)}{\sin^2(x)-\cos^2(x)})
